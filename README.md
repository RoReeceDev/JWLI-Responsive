## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML, CSS

To create this template site based on the design image given to me, I used multiple sections. I used float to have the sections stack on each other the way I wanted. I used a form with and input and submit button in the first section of the page and at the time of the footer. For the header I used a nav element and and for the footer, I split it into three sections with varying widths and then split the bottom section of the footer into 4 sections to separate the content more efficiently. Finally I used media queries to make the site responsive from the largest screen to the smallest screen.

## Lessons Learned:

In this project, I learn how to property use divs for styling. Ilearned how to struture a more indepth footer. Finally, I learned what content decisions to make when making a site responsive.
